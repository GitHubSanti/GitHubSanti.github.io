                <p>Hi, I am Santi. I was born in Medellin, Colombia and moved to the US at the age of six. I
                    was
                    raised in Charlotte, North Carolina and went to college at NC State for Biomedical Engineering. This
                    was where I was first introduced to coding with a microcontrollers class where we coded first in
                    asembly language and then in C. With my first job at Oracle I got a chance to learn SQL thru my job
                    role and used
                    company resources to become Java certified. When I changed jobs and started working for Fujifilm
                    Medical Systems, I enrolled in a fullstack web development course to learn about CSS, HTML,
                    javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Node.js, React.js and a variety of other technologies. </p>
                <p>I also have other interests besides coding. I am a sports fan, specifically basketball
                    and football professional or collegiate. It doesn't take much to get ;I've also been playing
                    basketball ever since I was a little
                    kid and first got to the US. I do everything I can to travel as much as possible. I've been to </p>
